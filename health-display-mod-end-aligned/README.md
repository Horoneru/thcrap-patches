# Health display mod for th155 - End-aligned variant

A simple mod allowing you to see exact health values on health gauges. This is aligned to the end of each health gauge.

Since modding is at its early stages, I couldn't easily make it configurable and
another versions exists where the value is centered on each health gauge.

The plan is to make _one_ repo later that combines the two as a configuration option.

Since end-aligned was requested by SoG, two repos have been created to provide that option early on.
